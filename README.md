# With Vincent Full-Stack Developer Assessment

This project is a small web application that renders US legislator to a web interface with details about each as well as an image of each legislator.

There is a front end react application as well as a node.js backend express server.

The backend express server has two endpoints.

The first endpoint is used to retreive all legislators.

The second endpoint used to retreive a jpeg image of a specific legislator, convert that image to a webp image and then save that image to a caching layer. It will also check this cache first before going out starting this process
